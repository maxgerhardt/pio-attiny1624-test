# PlatformIO ATTiny1624 Test

## Description

This is a minimal project which adds support for the ATTiny1624 in MegaTiny core through a custom board definition file 
and updated core & toolchain packages.

## Notes

The toolchain link in the `platformio.ini` is Windows-specific. See the alternative Linux link if you are on Linux instead 
of Windows.
